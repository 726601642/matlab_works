What is this:

AMR-NB encoder, which generates AMR-NB files, which can be decoded by standard decoder.
Please use this for Speech coding study purpose.

The code is not cleaned and not modular but is a short code and can be easily understood.
Appropriate comments have been added, but more comments will be added eventually.

How to Run:

1. Run the main_amrnb.m file.
2. test.out file is generated by the AMR-NB encoder.
3. To Decode this AMR file using standard exe, run the runme.bat file.
4. Output speaker.pcm is 16-bit, mono pcm file.

Known Limitations:

1. The encoded output is not bit exact with standard encoder.
2. Fractional pitch search is not implemented, open loop pitch searches are taken as final pitch values.
3. Only 5.9 Kbps mode encoding supported.
